üöÄ Why I Built This
I wanted to solve the daily "what should I eat this week?" problem while learning full-stack development. This project represents the frontend phase of my learning journey - building a complete user experience with API integration and state management.
Currently expanding this project to include:

Backend API built with FastAPI
PostgreSQL database for cross-device sync
User authentication
Custom recipe additions

üí° Key Learning Outcomes
Through building this project, I gained experience with:

External API integration and data fetching
Complex state management across multiple components
Modal patterns and user interaction flows
localStorage for client-side data persistence
TypeScript for type-safe React development
Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
Multi-page navigation and routing

üéØ Future Improvements

User authentication and accounts
Backend API with FastAPI + PostgreSQL
Cross-device synchronization
Grocery list generation from meal plan
Custom recipe creation and storage
Nutritional information tracking
Share meal plans with others
